        The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ ⓘ EYE-fəl; French: Tour Eiffel [tuʁ ɛfɛl] ⓘ)
        is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.
        It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed
        and built the tower from 1887 to 1889. Locally nicknamed "La dame de
        fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of
        the 1889 World's Fair, and to crown the centennial anniversary of the
        French Revolution. Although initially criticised by some of France's
        leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a
        global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable
        structures in the world.[5] The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in
        2022.[6] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance
        fee in the world:[7] 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was
        designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO
        World Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991.
